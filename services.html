        especially those with fine hair. No amount of teasing, hair spray, or hot rollers can help boost their roots.
        Adding an express service for extra volume would be an easy sell to ose suffering from flat hair.
        You can either add volumizing products such as shampoos and conditioners when washing their hair. Or you can
        add thickening serums and sprays that will help lift hair for extra volume when blow-dryingth.</p>

            alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" align="bottom" />When women think of a hair up-do, it’s easy to picture
        an overly
        styled prom look. Or a look that needed tons and tons of hair spray and an assortment of hot tools to keep it in
        place.

        Many women like to have their hair styled in a natural, effortless way. They do not want to sit in a chair for
        hours and end up with an intricate up-do that looks

        Adding in an express up-do service can be a big moneymaker for your hair salon. You can either add an easy,
        natural daytime up-do or have a more stylish evening express up-do.

        All you need is a little bit of hair spray, some bobby pins, and about fifteen extra minutes. An express up-do
        is an easy add-on that can be tacked onto the end of a normal cut and blow-dry..</p>

            alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" align="bottom" />Dull, lifeless hair is one of the most dreaded of hair
        ailments.
        Whether it be from harsh chemicals, heat damage, or improper hair care, no one wants to have lackluster hair
        that does not gleam from the inside out.

        Add in a quick super shine or gloss treatment to give your clients shiny, beautiful hair. Gloss treatments are a
        quick salon service that can add a lot to your salon profits.</p>

    <p id="service4"><img

            width="100" height="100" align="bottom" />As a hair salon owner, you cannot be ignoring a major client base
        – males. Males are a surprising potential client that can bring in major profits to your salon with minimal
        effort on your part.

        Some express salon services you can offer to men include scalp massages, shampoos, head and beard balms, beard
        trimmings and shampoos, and more. These services all take less than thirty minutes.

        This is a great addition to make to your services menu. Your clients will feel encouraged to bring their
        husbands and boyfriends and treat them to a service while they are getting their regular service.</p>

            alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" align="bottom" />Who doesn’t love a neck and shoulder massage? Offering
        a luxurious neck and
        shoulder massage takes up zero extra inventory. No products need to be used, although you can add some essential
        oils to boost the experience.

        Before they begin treatment, you can perform a neck and shoulder massage to help loosen up their muscles and get
        them to a more relaxed state. You will be surprised by how many people will be adding this quick salon service
        to their regular treatment over time.</p>

            height="100" align="bottom" />Hair masks are growing in popularity. They are an easy way to restore damaged
        hair, add shine, and give life back to dull hair.

        Many hair masks take anywhere from ten to twenty minutes and are an easy add-on. While your client is soaking in
        the benefits of their hair mask, it is also a great time to add on other express services. You can do a hot
        towel treatment or a neck and shoulder massage at this point.

        In this way, you can get two or even three express services in one. That makes a hair mask a great express salon
        service to add.
